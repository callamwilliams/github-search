# GitHub Search

## Installation

Run `npm i && npm start`

Run `npm start` once packages are installed to starter server and React App

Run `npm test` to Run tests for one redux-saga

Run `npm server-test` for a basic integration test of the node API

* You might need to add credentials in an env file, so I've added an `.env.sample` so everything is in the right place. Do this by going to [the developers page in GitHub](https://github.com/settings/developers) > OAuth Apps > New OAuth app, and copying the credentials over.

## Explain process

First I set up the API proxy server with Node and Express. I had planned to create some set routes, but ran out of time, so ended up handling the routing on the frontend and using a wildcard to accept all incoming connections to `/api/*`

I set up a custom webpack config with eslint, custom babel config, webpack-dev-server, hot module reloading and loader support for all common file types. There are three files in `/config` that handle development, production, and shared assets.

I sketched out a basic flow of how the application would work and what components would be required. And thought of a simple layout for the page design.

I chose to use redux-sagas for async data handling as they are fairly common on large scale applications, and have a few benefits over redux-thunk. It's probably overkill for an application of this size, but it's good to demonstrate.

Once I had a working application, I refactored some components and did a quick pass over the code.

Then I wrote some tests for one of my sagas, and did a basic integration test of the node API.

Unfortunately I didn't have enough time to write any unit or E2E tests;

### Improvements

- Normalise the data coming back from the API
- Update the components with the normalised data
- Write unit and integration tests
- Write E2E tests
- The `getRepos()` action probably has too many arguments(4) which probably means that the repos saga is doing too much. It'd be nice to abstract this out and make it more granular.
- Set some non-wildcard routes on the server
- Add some animation/polish
- Run some optimisation tasks

## Explain how Iâ€™d make it deployable

For the frontend app, I would create an S3 bucket, run the `build` task and deploy the static files the get put in the public folder.

I'd refactor the Node server to make sure it wasn't sharing dependencies with the frontend and that we have updated .env paths for a production environment. Then I'd use [Elastic Beanstalk with NGINX](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/nodejs-platform-proxy.html) on AWS for the node server.

I'd then set up a domain name, and SSL certificates.
